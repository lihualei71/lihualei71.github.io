Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Statistics Department] at Stanford University, advised by Professor [https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/ Emmanuel Candes]. 

Previously I got my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, advised by Professors [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bickel/ Peter Bickel] and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ Michael Jordan]. I was also very fortunate to be supervised by Professors [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/noureddine-el-karoui Noureddine El Karoui], [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/ William Fithian] and [https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/ Peng Ding] on particular projects. Prior to this, I was major in mathematics and statistics in [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University] with an economic minor in [http://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/ China Center for Economic Research at Peking University]. I was pleased to be a research assistant with Professor [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/static/interface/people.htm?uid=wul Lan Wu] and supervised by Professor [http://www.public.iastate.edu/~songchen/ Song Xi Chen] on my undergraduate thesis.
