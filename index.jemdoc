Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in the [http://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Statistics Department] at UC Berkeley. My advisors\n
are Professors [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bickel/ Peter Bickel] and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ Michael Jordan]. I am also very fortunate to be supervised by \n
Professors [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/noureddine-el-karoui Noureddine El Karoui], [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/ William Fithian] and [https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/ Peng Ding] on particular projects. \n
Last year I was grateful to be supported by [https://www.citadel.com/ Citadel Fellowship].

Previously I was major in mathematics and statistics in [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences at \n
Peking University] with an economic minor in [http://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/ China Center for Economic Research at Peking \n
University]. I was pleased to be a research assistant with Professor [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/static/interface/people.htm?uid=wul Lan Wu] and supervised by \n
Professor [http://www.public.iastate.edu/~songchen/ Song Xi Chen] on my undergraduate thesis.
